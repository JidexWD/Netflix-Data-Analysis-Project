  - Data Overview
    excel spread sheets was used in data overview to get he general understanding of the dataset

  - Data CLeaning
    Ms Excel was used in data cleaning which included chaning data type, putting approraite entries where they should be and so on.

  - Data Transformation
    Ms excel has so many features that make the transformation of data to be done at a very high level. columns were split into seperate parts and some columes were moved into another sheet with the show Id as the key

## Data Analysis 
  The Analitics of this data set was carried out with Power BI which has an array of features that make analyzing data very easy but also very high level. here we see the ER daigram being connect to form a relationship between different     tables.

  Here we utilized the Filter pane, Visualization pane and Data Pain to perform an indepth analysis of the data set

## Final Thoughts

In the world of data analytics, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a vital role in uncovering insights and preparing data for deeper analysis. Before diving into complex models or making decisions, analysts rely on EDA to understand the structure, patterns, and anomalies within a dataset.

### Why EDA Matters

1. **Understanding the Data**  
   EDA helps analysts familiarize themselves with the dataset, identifying variables, distributions, and underlying structures that may impact analysis.

2. **Detecting Anomalies & Outliers**  
   Outliers and missing values can distort results. EDA helps identify these irregularities, ensuring data quality before applying statistical methods.

3. **Feature Selection & Engineering**  
   Not all variables contribute equally to insights. EDA helps pinpoint the most relevant features, leading to better predictive models and efficiency.

4. **Finding Patterns & Relationships**  
   Through visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices, EDA reveals trends, dependencies, and relationships between variables.

5. **Validating Assumptions**  
   Many statistical methods and machine learning models rely on assumptions. EDA ensures that these assumptions hold true, preventing flawed analyses.

6. **Enhancing Decision-Making**  
   Businesses and organizations rely on data-driven decisions. EDA provides a foundation for making informed choices, leading to better strategies and outcomes.

### Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis is more than just an initial step—it’s a crucial process that shapes the accuracy and reliability of data-driven insights. By thoroughly exploring data, analysts ensure that their findings are not only accurate but also actionable. Whether for finance, healthcare, or marketing, EDA remains an indispensable tool in the data science toolkit.
